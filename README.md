# Recommender-systems

in this code along project, I experimented with the two most common types of recommender systems,
which are collaborative filtering and content-based.

REcommender systems are among the most popular and the most widely used ML Algorithms.

The significance of this project lies in it's ability to provide recommendations for items in a wide spectrum of instances;
based on user attitude(Content-based) or also similarities between user attitude towards items, "wisdom of the crowd"(collaborative filtering).

Examples of companies operating some form of recommender systems include;

-Amazon recommendations for customer online store

-Netflix movie recommendations among others
