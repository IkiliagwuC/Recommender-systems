# Recommender-systems

in this code along project, I experimented with the two most common types of recommender systems,
which are collaborative filtering and content-based.

The significance of this project lies in it's ability to provide recommendations for items in a wide spectrum of instances;
based on user attitude and also similarities between them.
Examples include;
-Amazon recommendations for customer online store
-Netflix movie recommendations among others
